Zander Lewis (TheMidnightWolf or WolfTheDev) started this project with some help with ChatGPT on February 16, 2024. Zander started this project at age 15 and came up with the idea that XX can be a bridge between languages, doing what other languages couldn't do (see [About XX](https://github.com/WolfTheDeveloper/XX#about-xx)).

For now, you run the program as 'python main.py xxfilename.xx'. For example, you would run 'python main.py example.xx' to run your program.
