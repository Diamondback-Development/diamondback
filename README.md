## Diamondback Founder

Zander Lewis (TheMidnightWolf or WolfTheDev) started this project with some help with ChatGPT on February 16, 2024. Zander started this project at age 15 and came up with the idea that Diamondback can be a bridge between languages, doing what other languages couldn't do (see [About Diamondback](https://github.com/Diamondback-Development/diamondback#about-diamondback)).

## How to run Diamondback

For now, you download main.py and run the program as 'python diamondback-interpreter.py dbfilename.diba'. For example, you would run 'python diamondback-interpreter.py example.diba' to run your program.
